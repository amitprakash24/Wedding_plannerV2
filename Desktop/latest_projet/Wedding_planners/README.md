Wedding Planner Management
# Idea details:
This Wedding Planner is a software solution designed to streamline wedding planning while directly contributing to decent work and economic growth. Our platform connects users with local service providers such as caterers, decorators, photographers, musicians and event staff—creating structured, reliable job opportunities in a largely informal sector.
Unlike traditional wedding apps focused only on the client, this software actively supports the workforce behind the events, making weddings a channel for sustainable development. It helps transition informal work into formal, fair and productive employment, exactly as envisioned by SDG 8.

Our software introduces professionalism and stability to the gig-based event industry by:
Allowing vendors to register and showcase their services
Offering a standardized pricing system to ensure fair wages
Providing digital contracts and payment tracking for job security
Enabling reviews and ratings to build trustworthy reputations
